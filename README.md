Hello Reader,

I am setting out to develop VedaOS, a Linux-based operating system designed for everyone—including myself. It’s a simple, hands-on project aimed at exploring the inner workings of operating systems, not a production-ready solution. Currently, I’m in the early planning and development stage, and I look forward to sharing this journey with fellow enthusiasts.

### What is VedaOS?

VedaOS is a minimalist, tiny, and lightweight Linux-based OS that focuses on implementing the core functionalities of an operating system. The goal is to build a kernel that demonstrates the practical aspects of OS development without the overhead of modern systems.

### Genuine Features

- **Modular Kernel Architecture:**  
  A clean and modular design that makes it easier to understand how different parts of the OS interact and can be independently developed or replaced.

- **Basic Process & Memory Management:**  
  Implements simple process scheduling and memory management techniques to demonstrate multitasking and efficient resource utilization.

- **Fundamental File System Support:**  
  Includes a basic file system, allowing for file operations that help illustrate how data is stored and managed on disk.

- **Device Driver Framework:**  
  Provides a structure for integrating essential device drivers, enabling interaction with hardware components in a straightforward manner.

- **Command-Line Interface:**  
  A simple shell interface for interacting with the system, giving users a taste of how operating systems handle user commands.

### Getting Started (Planned)

Over the coming weeks, I will document the entire process—from setting up the development environment to building and running the OS. Soon, you’ll be able to:

1. Clone the Git repository.
2. Compile the OS using a basic toolchain.
3. Launch it using a QEMU emulator:
   ```bash
   make qemu
   ```

Thank you for your interest in VedaOS. This project isn’t about flashy features—it’s about understanding and experimenting with the fundamentals of operating systems. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to join me on this exploratory adventure.

Happy coding!
